Ключевые слова: старость, пожилые люди, семья, пансионат.
Аннотация: Старость - социальное явление и одна из реальных ступеней жизненного цикла людей. Общество обязано готовить каждого из нас к этой жизненной ступени при помощи различных подходов и методов для того, чтобы мы могли вести здоровый образ жизни. Исследования показывают, что люди, получившие требуемую подготовку, в состоянии в течение долгого времени вести активный образ жизни, чувствовать себя молодым, быть активными гражданами страны, включенными в систему общественных отношений, и являться ценным человеческим капиталом.
Object: Recognition of effective factors in coming or living the aged to sanatoriums.
Materials and Method: In this research 504 the aged more than 60 years old have been selected by systematic randomly sampling (246 ones resident in sanatoriums of the country as the main group and 258 ones non-sanatoriums control group). This research is an experimental and applied one.
Data - gathering instruments, observations and intervicul had been Pre- setting with the aged and their families.
Finding: Widowhood in the elderly and the fall of social status of aged are some of the another factors in sanatorium as the social status of the main group is %13 while in the compare group 34/2%
Introduction: Progress in medical science, techniques and technology in medicine, improvement and Rehabilitation in hygienic considerations and nutrition condition, have increased the aged population in the world and the same in Iran. (1, 2, 3)
As the fact, the aged population of the world in 1970 was more than 291 million, that it was equivalent 8% percent of the world population and it is estimated that in 2050 it will made 37% Europe population and 21% developing countries population. (1, 3, 4)
In Iran (according to public census) aged population in comparison with whole population had an increasing nerolu-tion. (3)
Employment, marriage, living individually especially in towns made our aged population be alone and isolated and the depraved following of it; mental and manner disorder (3) to the extend that they have no way except accepting this changing or taking refugee to sanatorium (11), and this is a warning that necessitating consideration and programming about it (4,12). So that government is responsible for adopting policies to giving them their prevented security back (4, 13, and 14). So “except the realized, purposeful education which is carried out by parents, the child is influenced by psychological atmosphere of family ability to live. And the effect from this influence collects in the course of a growing of the child, refracting in structure of its person” [13, p. 45].
Object: Surveying effective factors mental physical and manner disorder living the aged in sanatorium the elderly.
Method: This is an experimental and besides it, an applied one. The foundation of this research, like most of research, based on observation, accuracy in observation and reputable experiences.
Or in other words, Induction Reasoning: It means universalizing the data that resulting from observations, so in this
direction, any kind of data should be examined for arriving at provable experiment laws.
Study of population: In this experimental research for finding existing factors of the subject and surveying and examination suppositions; 2 groups were studied.
First group or main group: For this group; 246 aged individuals were selected from 219 sanatoriums of the country, who 150 aged from 1080 sanatorium in Tehran, and 96 aged were selected from 1114 township sanatorium, and all of them were selected randomly by systematic sampling method .
Formula applicable for sampling T2 - S2
N = ................
E2
Second group or compare group: For this group 258 aged of Tehran resident family and 14 province of the country that had characteristics of sanatorium were selected. Like main group 150 aged from Tehran family and 96 aged from township families and all of them were selected randomly by systematic sampling method.
Instrument of gathering data: Pre - setting observation and interview with aged and their families and interview with authorities in the field of elderly.
In this project 10 hypothesis have been conjectured which for the purpose of refraining from prolonging the Article, we
attend to three proven hypothesis.
1st hypothesis, Table No. 2, a lessening in the social status of the aged results in committing them to the Aged Citizen’s’ sanatorium.
Hypothesis 1: The fall of social status of the aged has a meaningful relation with his sanatorium as social class of aged sanatorium is 13% and in family 34/2%
Table No. 3 relates to the hypothesis that the more religious their family is , the less is the probability of committing of the aged to the sanatorium .
2nd hypothesis, the religiosity of the family and the aged is a factor in non-commitment of the aged to the sanatorium.
As observed from the above Table ,the factor of being very religious is %10.6 in the sanatorium and %29.8 in the family .
3nd hypothesis subject of Table No.4 loneliness and the need for care and Rehabilitation of the aged results in committing them to the sanatorium.
Hypothesis 3: Aged loneliness and handicap and his sanatorium has some relation as our study shows 65% of sanatorium had a strong loneliness feeling but this feeling was 40/2 for Non- sanatorium.

Discussion and conclusion
53/2% women and 4б/8% men formed the whole population
From 24б sanatoriums; б0/б% women and 39/4% men formed the whole population. So that women are sent to the sanatorium more than men.
Widowhood in the elderly is one of the main factors in sanatorium as 89/5% of the sanatorium was widow.
For lonely aged; the necessity of establishing sanatorium center for them is more than other kind of aged; as sanatorium 84% and non-sanatorium 44% felt its necessity .
Fall in social status of the aged is another factor. As social status of sanatorium was 13% but in non - sanatorium was 34/2%.
Negative view of the aged relative to elderly is another factor in sanatorium. As 34/5% relatives of sanatorium had a negative view while non - sanatorium was 21/2%
Lack of family kinship is another factor. As 31/б% sanatorium lacked family kinship against 5/8% in the family kinship.
Against family structure transformation from expanded to nuclear, but offspring is considered as the elderly stick in Iranian culture and society.

Annotation: In the contemporary world, especially in the industrial societies, a going has been manifested as the century phenomenon. Kinship and family Transformation from expanded to nuclear and it’s depraved following, not as developed societies, but at comparative extend has been a problematic issue. With the consideration of 7/27 percent of aged population in Iran (Publication of statistical center of IRAN 2006) deliberating and recognizing various dimensions of elderly and finding the causes of leaving them to sanatorium, is necessary.
