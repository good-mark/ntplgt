 II. Read, translate and retell the text:
 Nick is a student. He studies at the Altai State Technical University. He is in the first year of the full-time department, so he goes to the University every day except Sunday. It takes much effort to study at the University and he tries to keep regular hours. Nick’s classes begin at 8.15. He lives far from the University, so he must get up very early. The alarm clock wakes him up at 6.30 a.m. Sometimes he turns off the alarm and lies in bed until his mother wakes him up again. While his mother wakes him up she is repeating the words: «An early riser is sure to be in luck».
 He jumps out of bed, opens the window, does his morning exercises to the music, makes the bed and goes to the bathroom. In the bathroom he shaves, cleans his teeth and washes his face and hands. Sometimes he takes a cold or a warm shower. Then he dries himself on a towel and combs his hair in front of the mirror. Then he goes back to his room and dresses. In some minutes he is ready for breakfast. He usually has a cup of tea or coffee and a sandwich or two. Nick is always in a hurry because he doesn’t want to be late for classes. At 7.30 he leaves home for the University. He usually gets to the University by bus. The bus stop is only a few minutes walk from Nick’s house. It takes him about half an hour to get to the University. So, he comes to the University some minutes before the bell rings. He has enough time to get everything ready for his classes. His days are not like each other because he has a different time-table every day. As a rule he has 2 or 3 lectures and a seminar or a lab. Sometimes there is a gap of 2 hours that comes in between lectures or practical classes and it’s not convenient for both students and teachers. Nick does his best not to miss classes because he knows that missing classes is a sure way to fail at exams. At about 12 o’clock he has a break for lunch. Nick doesn’t go to the canteen he takes a snack in the buffet. After the break classes go on. They are usually over at about 2 o’clock. After classes Nick usually goes home but sometimes he stays in the reading-room to get ready for a seminar. After a day of hard work Nick feels very tired and he hurries home. At home he has dinner and a short rest, then he does his homework and helps his mother about the house. In the evening Nick watches a serial or a detective story on TV. Sometimes he goes out with his friends. Nick goes in for sports. Twice a week he plays volley-ball in the University gym. He returns home at 8 p.m. and has supper. When he stays at home in the evening he has supper with his parents. At supper they talk about different sort of things, including plans for the coming day.
	
 At about 12 o’clock Nick goes to bed. You see, Nick is too busy and he always looks forward to the week-end.
  
 III. Read, translate and reproduce the dialogues:
 Dialogue 1.
 - I got up at 6.30 a.m. And you?
 - I got up at 8 a.m.
 - Why so late?
 - Because I have my classes later than usual.
  
 Dialogue 2.
 - Will you help me, please?
 - I would if I could. I’ve got a lot of work to do.
 - What are you busy with?çàãðóçêà...
- I have got to read and to translate two texts from English into Russian.
 - How much time does it take you to do this?
 - It’s hard to say. I’ll be busy till the end of the working day.
 - What time will you be free?
 - At about 6 p.m.
 - May I give you a lift?
 - It will be very kind of you.
 - That’s settled. See you soon.
 - Good bye.
 - Good bye.
  
 Dialogue 3.
 Victor. – Are you through with your homework?
 Nick. – Oh, no Victor. I have so many things to do for Monday.
 Victor. – But look at you watch. It’s a quarter to twelve. It’s time to go to bed.
 Nick. – Never mind. Tomorrow is Sunday. It’s our day-off.
 
 Dialogue 4.
 - Hello, Nick! Did you have a good day?
 - Not bad! The usual sort of thing. Practical classes, lectures. You know.
 - Did you try to take your English exam ahead of time?
 - Well, I did. But the teacher advised me to get ready for English better.
 - I see.
 - After classes I went to the reading-room. It took me an hour to make an abstract of the paper recommended by our teacher of physics. And then Kate turned up. As usual.
 - So, what did you do?
 - We had a long talk.
 - Oh, yes. What about?
 - Oh, this and that. Things. You know. Then we had a lunch.
 - Where did you go? Somewhere nice?
 - No, just the cafe round the corner. Then I returned to the University and stayed at the reading-room till 17 (5 p.m.)
 - Sounds like a boring day.
 - I don’t think so. There is a very good proverb: «Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.»
 - I think you are right.
 
 Dialogue 5.
 - Pete, you look so tired. You don’t feel well, do you?
 - It’s not that. I am really tired. I am going to take my last exam. It’s English.
 - Then you have a lot of work to do!
 - Sure. I’ve got a small cassette-player and I listen to different texts and dialogues. I read and translate special texts and retell them. I also pay much attention to topics.
 - Excuse my curiosity, what mark would you like to have in English?
 - You’d better ask me what mark I don’t want to have.
 - I know you have been fond of English since your childhood.
 - It goes without saying that English is my favourite subject and I don’t want to have «sat» in my credit test book.
 - How long does your working day last now?
 - From morning till late at night.
 - If you go to bed very late, I think it’s very difficult for you to get up early.
 - I’m not an early riser, so I get up at 8. I am sorry I must be going. Time presses.
 - Good-buy. But don’t forget to have a short rest after hard work. I wish you luck.
 - Thank you. See you soon.
