 PRIMARY AND SECONDARY MARKETS
 (ÏÅÐÂÈ×ÍÛÉ È ÂÒÎÐÈ×ÍÛÉ ÐÛÍÊÈ)
 Fixed-interest securities and ordinary shares are the main stock-in-trade of the securities markets and the Stock Exchange is the main securities market in the UK (and the New York Stock Exchange is the largest in the USA). By buying one or the other, investors are helping - directly or indirectly - to provide the finance that government or industry needs. Why "directly or indirectly"? Because the stockmarket is two markets in one: a primary market anda secondary market.
 A primary market is one in which the government, companies or other bodies can sell new securities to investors to raise cash.
 A secondary market is a market in which the investors can buy and sell these securities among each other. The buying and the selling in the secondary market does not directly affect the finances of government and companies. But if investors did not know they could buy and sell securities in the secondary market they might well be reluctant to put up cash for the government or companies by buying securities in the primary market when they were first issued. And the prices established by the buying and selling by investors in the secondary market help to determine the price that government and companies will have to pay next time they need to issue further securities for cash in the primary market. A reasonably liquid secondary market is nonnally considered vital for a healthy primary market.
